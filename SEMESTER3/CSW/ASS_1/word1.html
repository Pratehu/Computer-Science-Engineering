            It is a delightful and somewhat whimsical term that describes the occurrence of unexpected and fortunate discoveries or pleasant surprises while seeking something unrelated or without prior intention. It refers to the phenomenon of stumbling upon something valuable, enjoyable, or meaningful by chance or accident.
            The word "serendipity" was coined by the 18th-century English writer Horace Walpole, who derived it from the Persian fairy tale<u>"The Three Princes of Serendip."</u>
